# react-native-widget-extension-app-clip

A quick, WIP fork of [react-native-widget-extension](https://github.com/joshuajaco/react-native-widget-extension) with support for widget extensions in App Clips.

(App Clips only support live activities, not normal widgets)

```sh
npx expo install react-native-widget-extension-app-clip
```

I would've kept this on git only but my app wouldn't build unless I published it to a registry, idk why.

## TODO

- [ ] Fix building when using in conjunction with `react-native-widget-extension`
